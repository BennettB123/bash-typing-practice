# bash-typing-practice
A set of bash scripts that help you practice your typing skills.

This was a program I wrote in May of 2019 to learn more about bash scripting.

# How To
To run the bash script: 
* copy words.txt, Game.sh, and backgroundcode.sh into a directory.
* Navigate to this directory in a bash shell and type ```./Game.sh```.
* You will be prompted to enter ```1```, ```2```, or ```3``` to select how long you would like to play the game for.
* After the countdown, type the words that appear to get points. The game will end automatically after the amount of time you selected has elapsed.
